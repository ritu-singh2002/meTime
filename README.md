It is a Mental Health app which will not only help in spreading Mental Health awareness, but also comprises various Self Care habits that a person can adapt for better mental and physical health. This app is for everyone who want positivity and motivation in their lives or want to live a healthy lifestyle. 
There have been several technological innovations for mental health like smart phone apps which help people cope with anxiety or depression and people who suffer from addiction. People can find guidance through such apps. Our application is a small initiative along the same line.
